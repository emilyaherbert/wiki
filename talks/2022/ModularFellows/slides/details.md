### True modularity:

<p class="size">Fuel is modular and designed to operate in multiple different configurations:</p>

<div class="container">

<div class="col">
<img src="./images/fuel_configs.png" height=400px/>
</div>
<div class="col">
<ul class="smallersize">
    <li>L1</li>
    <li>classical rollup</li>
    <li>sovereign rollup</li>
</ul>

</div>

</div>

Note:

While Fuel can run in this configuration, we do not promote or support this outside of testing, as the broader mission of Fuel is to enhance existing blockchains such as Ethereum as a high-performance execution layer.
