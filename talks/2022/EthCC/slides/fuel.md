### The Problem:
L2s don‚Äôt solve the scalability crisis alone

Note:

L2s have opened up a margin of cost reduction for access to the Ethereum ecosystem

the total throughput increase has been modest at best

in times of high traffic on Ethereum, L2s have failed to keep costs low, often rising to several dollars per transaction

if we want to achieve true global access to blockchain technology, we need to tackle this problem

reduce waste and inefficiency, but opens up new use cases never before seen in the blockchain space

### The Fix:
the modular blockchain

Note:

ongoing colossal shift happening in layer-1 (L1) blockchain architectures

moving away from a monolithic design, where consensus, data availability, and execution are tightly coupled to modular

This separation allows for specialization at the base layer, delivering a significant increase in bandwidth capacity
