### the year is 2018...

<ul>
    <li>senior thesis</li>
    <li>graduated from Trinity</li>
    <li>I wanted to be a university professor eventually</li>
    <li>year 1 of PhD</li>
    <li>research on using neural networks to model probability distributions</li>
</ul>

###

probability distributions tell us the likelihood of different outcomes:

<img src="./images/prob.jpg"/>

we can query a distribution to generate a random number

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <p>
            modeling probability distributions
            </p>
        </td>
        <td>
            ≈
        </td>
        <td>
            "generating random numbers using probabilities"
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2 class="special-header">👩‍💻<h2>

### 

how do we figure out the distribution if we only have raw data?

→ we can use neural networks to "learn" the distribution, and to generate more data ←

        <td>
            <img src="./images/nim_9.png" width=400px/>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

### the year is 2019...

<ul>
    <li>year 2 of PhD</li>
    <li>didn't want to work on neural networks anymore</li>
    <li>started researching programming language design</li>
</ul>

### 

programming languages have different designs for different uses:

    <tr>
        <td>
            <img src="./images/scala.png" width=400px/>
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src="./images/haskell.png" width=400px/>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <img src="./images/js.png" width=400px/>
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src="./images/rust.png" width=400px/>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2 class="special-header">👩‍💻<h2>

### 

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            what if we want to use a language that we love...
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src="./images/js.png" width=100px/>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            but still get the benefits of using a "safe" language?
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src="./images/rust.png" width=100px/>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

### how does grad school work for CS?

                <li>research-focused</li>
                <li>paid (but not the big bucks)</li>

### *GOOD* reasons to go to grad school:

<ul>
    <li>there is a topic, research question, or field that you want to devote time to</li>
    <li>the job that you want requires a graduate degree</li>
        <ul>
            <li>full-time professor at a college or university</li>
            <li>full-time researcher at a company or university</li>
        </ul>
</ul>

---

### *"so-so"* reasons to go to grad school:

<ul>
    <li>you really like going to school</li>
    <li>you don't know what job you want</li>
</ul>

---

### reasons to *NOT* go to grad school:

<ul>
    <li>you don't like doing research</li>
    <li>you don't need a graduate degree for the job you want</li>
    <li>you want to make a lot money right away 🤑</li>
</ul>

### 

I got a job working on programming language design!

    <li>(p.s. I still don't!)</li>
</ul>

### it's ok to change your mind

<ul>
    <li>learned more about computer science</li>
    <li>had fun doing research</li>
    <li>met amazing people</li>
    <li>recieved a Master's degree</li>
    <li>this is what worked for me</li>
    <li>I can always go back!</li>
