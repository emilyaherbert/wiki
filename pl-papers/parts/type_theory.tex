\section {Gradual Typing with Unification-based Inference \cite{siek2008gradual}}
Gradual typing is a combination between static typing and dynamic typing, based
on the presence of type annotations. ``This paper studies the combination of
gradual typing and unification-based type inference with the goal of developing
a system that helps programmers increase the amount of static checking in their
program. ... The key question in combining gradual typing and type inference is
how should the dynamic type of a gradual system interact with the type variables
of a type inference system. ... This paper presents a new type system based on
the idea that a solution for a type variable should be as informative as any
type that constrains the variable.''
