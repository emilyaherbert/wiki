\section {The Expression Problem \cite{wadler1998expression}}
Proposes a solution to the expression problem - "goal is to define a datatype by
cases, where one can add new cases to the datatype and new functions over the
datatype, without recompiling existing code and while retaining static type
safety." Solution in GJ creates a series of types that are dependent on one
another, and relies on Interfaces for expression evaluation. Type variables can
be indexed by any inner class defined in the variable's bound.
