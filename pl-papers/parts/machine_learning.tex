\section {Typesafe Abstractions for Tensor Operations \cite{chen2017typesafe}}
Typesafe tensors for tensor operations and machine learning. Tensors created
with two types, the type (primitives) of the elements, and the phantom types
used to label dimensions. This allows operations to be checked at compile time
to ensure that all tensor operations are valid. Typesafe tensors are
differentiable and can be type-checked. Computation graphs are also typed, and
inputs/ outputs are also type-checked. Examples given for tensor operations ---
matrix multiplication, tensor contraction. Examples given for NN layers - FC,
conv, recurrent (recursive).
